//Question

// Develop a library system that manages various types of library items such as books, CDs, and DVDs.
// Each item has a title, a unique identifier, and a type-specific property (e.g., author for books).
// The system should allow users to check out items, calculate late fees based on the item type, and 
// determine the total value of all items in the library.
